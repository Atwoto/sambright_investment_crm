```

3. Make sure your `.env` file is in `.gitignore` to keep your API key secure

## Prompt Engineering

The AI is instructed to:

- Act as an expert house painting color consultant
- Analyze architectural style and surroundings
- Provide 3 distinct, professional recommendations
- Include specific color names and application details
- Explain reasoning for each recommendation

## Error Handling

The component handles:

- Missing API key (shows helpful error message)
- API failures (with user-friendly error messages)
- Invalid image formats
- JSON parsing errors (with fallback)
- Network issues

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:

- üé® Generate actual painted house visualizations (requires image generation API)
- üíæ Save recommendations to database
- üìß Email recommendations to clients
- üñºÔ∏è Side-by-side comparison view
- üìä Track popular color combinations
- üéØ Filter by house style (modern, traditional, etc.)
- üí∞ Cost estimation for paint quantities

## Troubleshooting

### "OpenRouter API key not configured" Error

- Make sure `.env` file exists in project root
- Verify the key is named exactly `VITE_OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
- Restart your dev server after adding the key

### Images Not Uploading

- Check file size (should be under 10MB)
- Verify file format (PNG, JPG, WEBP)
- Check browser console for errors

### AI Analysis Fails

- Verify your OpenRouter API key is valid
- Check your OpenRouter account has credits
- Ensure you have internet connection
- Check browser console for detailed error messages

### Recommendations Look Wrong

- Try uploading clearer images
- Include multiple angles of the house
- Ensure good lighting in photos
- Upload higher resolution images

## Security Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Security Considerations:**

1. **API Key Protection**

   - Never commit `.env` file to git
   - Keep API keys secret
   - Rotate keys if exposed

2. **Client-Side API Calls**

   - Current implementation makes API calls from browser
   - API key is exposed in browser (acceptable for OpenRouter)
   - For production, consider server-side proxy

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
   - Consider adding user quotas
   - Monitor API usage

## Support

For issues or questions:

1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Test with a simple house image first
4. Check OpenRouter API status

## Model Information

**DeepSeek Chat**

- Excellent vision capabilities
- Cost-effective pricing
- Fast response times
- Good at understanding architectural details

Alternative models you can try (update in `AIColorAdvisor.tsx`):

- `anthropic/claude-3-haiku` - More expensive but very accurate
- `google/gemini-pro-vision` - Good balance of cost and quality
- `openai/gpt-4-vision-preview` - Premium option

To change the model, update this line in `AIColorAdvisor.tsx`:

```typescript
model: "deepseek/deepseek-chat", // Change this to your preferred model
```
