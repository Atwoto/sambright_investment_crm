# Order Form Improvements - Complete

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Order Item Input Fields Too Small

**Problem:** The input fields for adding order items were tiny (h-9) and hard to see/use.

**Solution:**

- Changed layout from cramped 12-column grid to spacious full-width layout
- Increased input height from h-9 to h-10
- Made item description full-width with better label
- Organized Type, Quantity, and Price in a 3-column grid below
- Changed "Add" button to full-width "Add Item to Order" button
- Improved labels and placeholders for clarity
- Added proper spacing between fields

**Result:** Much easier to see what you're typing and add items to orders.

### 2. ✅ Payment Status Stuck on "Pending"

**Problem:** No way to change payment status after creating an order.

**Solutions Implemented:**

#### A. Quick "Mark as Paid" Button

- Added a green "Mark Paid" button on each order card
- Only shows when payment status is NOT "paid"
- One-click action to mark order as paid
- Updates database immediately
- Shows success toast notification

#### B. Payment Status in Edit Dialog

- Added "Status" dropdown to edit dialog (Draft, Sent, Accepted, Completed, Cancelled)
- Added "Payment Status" dropdown to edit dialog (Pending, Partial, Paid, Overdue)
- Both fields save to database when you click "Save Changes"

**Result:** You can now easily change payment status either:

- Quickly via "Mark Paid" button on the order card
- Or via Edit dialog for more control (including partial payments, overdue, etc.)

## Database Migration Required

Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Add payment_status column to orders table
ALTER TABLE orders
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS payment_status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending'
CHECK (payment_status IN ('pending', 'partial', 'paid', 'overdue'));

-- Add payment_method column if it doesn't exist
ALTER TABLE orders
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS payment_method TEXT;

-- Update existing orders to have 'pending' status if null
UPDATE orders
SET payment_status = 'pending'
WHERE payment_status IS NULL;
```

## Visual Changes

### Before:

- Tiny input fields (h-9, cramped in 12-column grid)

- Full-width item description field
- 3-column grid for Type/Qty/Price
