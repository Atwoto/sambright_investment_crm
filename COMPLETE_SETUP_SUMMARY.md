# Complete Setup Summary

## Current Status

✅ **Orders** - Working! Saving to database correctly
❌ **Projects** - Database error: needs table setup

## What You Need to Do

### For Projects to Work:

Run these 3 SQL queries in your Supabase SQL Editor:

#### 1. Create Projects Table (30 seconds)

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS projects (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  project_number VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  client_id UUID REFERENCES clients(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  description TEXT,
  project_type VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'painting',
  status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'planning',
  start_date DATE,
  end_date DATE,
  estimated_budget DECIMAL(10,2),
  actual_cost DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 0,
  location VARCHAR(255),
  notes TEXT,
  images TEXT[],
  video_link VARCHAR(500),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_projects_client ON projects(client_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_projects_status ON projects(status);
```

#### 2. Add Security Policies (10 seconds)

```sql
ALTER TABLE projects ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "Enable all for authenticated users" ON projects
  FOR ALL
  USING (true);
```

#### 3. Create Image Storage Bucket (20 seconds)

```sql
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public)
VALUES ('project-images', 'project-images', true)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;

CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to upload project images"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'project-images');

CREATE POLICY "Allow public read access to project images"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'project-images');

CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to delete project images"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
TO authenticated
USING (bucket_id = 'project-images');
```

### Then:

4. **Restart your dev server** (Ctrl+C, then `npm run dev`)
5. **Test creating a project**

## All Database Migrations Needed

Here's everything you need to run in Supabase SQL Editor (if you haven't already):

### Orders - Payment Status Column

```sql
ALTER TABLE orders
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS payment_status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending'
CHECK (payment_status IN ('pending', 'partial', 'paid', 'overdue'));

ALTER TABLE orders
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS payment_method TEXT;

UPDATE orders
SET payment_status = 'pending'
WHERE payment_status IS NULL;
```

## Deployment to Vercel

When you're ready to deploy:

1. **Make sure .env is NOT committed to Git** (it's already in .gitignore)
2. **Add environment variables in Vercel:**
   - Go to your Vercel project settings
   - Add `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
3. **Push your code to Git**
4. **Vercel will auto-deploy**

## Need Help?

If something doesn't work:

1. Check the browser console (F12) for error messages
2. Look at the specific troubleshooting guide for that feature
3. Share the error message with me

The error messages are now much more detailed and will tell you exactly what's wrong!

## Summary

**To fix projects right now:**

1. Copy the 3 SQL queries above
2. Paste them one by one in Supabase SQL Editor
3. Click Run for each
4. Restart your dev server
5. Try creating a project

That's it! Should take less than 2 minutes total.
