# Order Form Updates - Completed

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Scrollable Form Layout

The order form dialog now has:

- Fixed header at the top
- Scrollable content area in the middle
- Sticky footer with action buttons at the bottom
- Maximum height of 85vh to fit on screen
- Proper overflow handling for order items list

### 2. ✅ Client Dropdown with Auto-fill

- Client field is now a dropdown (Select component) instead of text input
- Shows all clients from the database with format: "Name - Email"
- When you select a client, it automatically fills:
  - Client ID (hidden, used for database relation)
  - Client Name
  - Client Email (disabled field, auto-filled)

### 3. ✅ Payment Status Field

- Added payment status dropdown with options:
  - Pending (default)
  - Partial
  - Paid
  - Overdue
- Payment status is now saved to the database
- Payment status is loaded from the database when viewing orders

## Database Migration Required

**IMPORTANT:** You need to run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Add payment_status column to orders table
ALTER TABLE orders
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS payment_status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending'
CHECK (payment_status IN ('pending', 'partial', 'paid', 'overdue'));

-- Add payment_method column if it doesn't exist
ALTER TABLE orders
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS payment_method TEXT;

-- Update existing orders to have 'pending' status if null
UPDATE orders
SET payment_status = 'pending'
WHERE payment_status IS NULL;
```

## Files Modified

1. **src/components/OrdersManager.tsx**

   - Updated data loading to read `payment_status` from database
   - Updated order creation to save `payment_status` and `payment_method`
   - Updated order editing to save `payment_status` and `payment_method`
   - Client dropdown already implemented with auto-fill
   - Form layout already scrollable with sticky footer

2. **add_payment_status_column.sql** (NEW)
   - SQL migration script to add payment_status column

## How to Test

1. Run the SQL migration in Supabase SQL Editor
2. Open the application
3. Click "Create Order"
4. Verify:
   - Form fits on screen even with multiple order items
   - Client dropdown shows all clients
   - Selecting a client auto-fills the email
   - Payment status dropdown is visible and functional
   - Buttons remain visible at bottom when scrolling
5. Create an order with payment status set to "Paid"
6. Refresh the page and verify the payment status is saved

## Notes

- The form uses `max-h-[85vh]` to ensure it fits on most screens
- The content area has `overflow-y-auto` for scrolling
- The footer has `sticky bottom-0` to stay visible
- Client ID is now properly saved to link orders with clients
- Payment status defaults to "pending" if not specified
