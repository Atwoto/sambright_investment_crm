# Dashboard & Reports - Now Using Real Data!

## What's Changed

Both the Dashboard and Reports tabs now use **real data from your Supabase database** instead of mock data.

## Dashboard Overview

### Already Dynamic ✅

The Dashboard was already partially dynamic. It now loads:

- **Total Products** - Count from products table
- **Total Clients** - Count from clients table
- **Pending Orders** - Count from orders table
- **Monthly Revenue** - Calculated from orders this month
- **Low Stock Items** - Products where stock_level < min_stock_level
- **Paintings Available** - Count of painting-type products
- **Paints In Stock** - Count of paint-type products
- **Recent Activity** - Last 5 inventory transactions

### Features:

- **Refresh Button** - Click to reload all data
- **Loading States** - Shows skeleton loaders while fetching
- **Error Handling** - Falls back to sample data if database fails
- **Real-time Calculations** - All metrics calculated from actual database records

## Reports & Analytics

### Now Fully Dynamic ✅

The Reports tab now loads real data for all sections:

### 1. Sales Analytics Tab

- **Monthly Revenue Trends** - Aggregates orders by month for last 12 months
- **Sales Growth** - Shows total sales trend over time
- **Revenue Breakdown** - Separates paintings vs paints revenue
- **Sales Summary** - Calculates totals, averages, and best month

**Data Source:** Orders table, grouped by month and product type

### 2. Product Performance Tab

- **Top Products by Revenue** - Ranks products by total sales
- **Product Categories** - Shows revenue split between paintings and paints
- **Detailed Performance Table** - Lists all products with units sold, revenue, and average price

**Data Source:** Order items aggregated by product name

### 3. Client Analysis Tab

- **Client Segments** - Distribution of clients (currently simplified percentages)
- **Client Growth** - Shows client breakdown by type
- **Client Insights** - Total clients, new clients, average value, repeat rate

**Data Source:** Clients table

### 4. Inventory Reports Tab

- **Low Stock Alerts** - Products below minimum stock level
- **Inventory Value** - Calculated value by category
- **Inventory Turnover** - Stock movement metrics

**Data Source:** Products table with stock level comparisons

## How It Works

### Data Loading Process:

1. **On Page Load:**

   - Fetches all relevant data from Supabase
   - Processes and aggregates the data
   - Updates charts and metrics

2. **Calculations:**

   - **Monthly Sales:** Groups orders by month, sums item totals
   - **Product Performance:** Aggregates order items by product name
   - **Client Segments:** Calculates percentages based on total clients
   - **Low Stock:** Filters products where `stock_level < min_stock_level`

3. **Error Handling:**
   - If database fetch fails, shows fallback mock data
   - Logs errors to console for debugging
   - Shows loading states during data fetch

## Key Metrics Explained

### Dashboard:

- **Total Revenue** - Sum of all order totals this month
- **Active Clients** - Total count of clients in database
- **Pending Orders** - Total count of all orders (you can filter by status later)
- **Low Stock Alerts** - Count of products below minimum stock

### Reports:

- **Total Revenue** - Sum of all orders in selected period
- **Paintings Sold** - Count of painting-type items sold
- **Avg Order Value** - Total revenue ÷ total items sold
- **Low Stock Items** - Products needing restock

## Customization Options

You can enhance the reports by:

### 1. Adding Date Filters

Currently shows last 12 months. You can add:

- Custom date range picker
- Filter by specific months
- Year-over-year comparisons

### 2. Better Client Segmentation

Currently uses simple percentages. You could:

- Add client_type field to clients table
- Calculate based on purchase history
- Segment by total spending

### 3. More Detailed Metrics

- Profit margins (if you add cost data)
- Customer lifetime value
- Inventory turnover rate
- Sales by region/location

### 4. Export Functionality

The "Export" button is ready - you can add:

- CSV export of reports
- PDF generation
- Email reports

## Database Requirements

For reports to work properly, ensure you have:

### Orders Table:

- `created_at` - For date grouping
- `items` - JSON array with order items
- `total` - Order total amount
- `status` - Order status

### Products Table:

- `stock_level` - Current stock
- `min_stock_level` - Minimum stock threshold
- `product_type` - 'painting' or 'paint'
- `name` - Product name

### Clients Table:

- Basic client information
- Used for counts and segmentation

## Performance Notes

- **Caching:** Data is loaded once per page visit
- **Refresh:** Click refresh button to reload data
- **Period Change:** Changing period dropdown reloads data
- **Optimization:** Consider adding database indexes on:
  - `orders.created_at`
  - `products.stock_level`
  - `products.product_type`

## Testing

To test with real data:

1. **Create some orders** with different products
2. **Add various products** with different stock levels
3. **Create multiple clients**
4. **Go to Dashboard** - see real counts and metrics
5. **Go to Reports** - see charts populated with your data

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:

- Real-time updates (using Supabase subscriptions)
- More granular date filtering
- Comparison with previous periods
- Forecasting and predictions
- Custom report builder
- Scheduled email reports
- Mobile-optimized charts
