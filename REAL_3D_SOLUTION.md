# Real 3D Image Generation Solution

## The Problem

- Nano Banana (google/gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview) is a **vision analysis model**
- It can analyze images but **cannot generate new images**
- That's why our current approach creates poor quality overlays instead of real 3D images

## The Solution

We need to integrate with actual **image generation models**:

### Option 1: DALL-E 3 Integration

```javascript
const response = await fetch("https://api.openai.com/v1/images/generations", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${OPENAI_API_KEY}`,
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    model: "dall-e-3",
    prompt: `Create a 3D architectural visualization of this house painted with ${colors.join(
      ", "
    )}. Professional 3D rendering with realistic lighting and shadows.`,
    size: "1024x1024",
    quality: "hd",
  }),
});
```

### Option 2: Midjourney API

```javascript
// Use Midjourney API for artistic 3D renderings
const prompt = `3D architectural visualization of house painted with ${colors.join(
  ", "
)}, photorealistic, professional lighting --ar 16:9 --v 6`;
```

### Option 3: Stable Diffusion

```javascript
// Use Stable Diffusion for custom 3D house generation
const response = await fetch(
  "https://api.stability.ai/v1/generation/stable-diffusion-xl-1024-v1-0/text-to-image",
  {
    // ... Stable Diffusion API call
  }
);
```

### Option 4: Google AI Studio Integration Helper

Create a feature that:

1. Generates the perfect prompt for Google AI Studio
2. Shows users exactly how to get the 3D results
3. Provides copy-paste prompts and instructions

## Recommendation

For immediate results, implement **Option 4** - help users get the same Google AI Studio results you achieved, but make it seamless within the app.
