# Implementation Summary - Projects & Client Improvements

## What Was Done

### 1. ✅ Projects Management System

- **Created ProjectsManager component** (`src/components/ProjectsManager.tsx`)
- **Added Projects navigation tab** in App.tsx
- **Database schema** provided in `update_projects_table.sql`

#### Features:

- Create, view, edit, and delete projects
- Link projects to clients
- Track project status (planning, in_progress, completed, on_hold, cancelled)
- Track estimated budget and actual costs
- Project types: painting, renovation, consultation, maintenance, custom
- Location tracking
- Start and end dates
- Notes and descriptions

### 2. ✅ Fixed Client Total Spent & Orders

- **Now pulls real data from orders table**
- Shows actual total spent (sum of all order totals)
- Shows actual order count per client
- Currency displays in KSh (Kenyan Shillings)

### 3. ✅ Database Schema

Run the SQL file `update_projects_table.sql` in your Supabase SQL editor to:

- Create/update projects table
- Add proper foreign key relationships
- Create indexes for performance
- Add automatic timestamp updates

## How to Use

### Step 1: Run the SQL

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Copy contents of `update_projects_table.sql`
3. Run the SQL script

### Step 2: Deploy

Push the code to Vercel - it will automatically deploy

### Step 3: Test

1. Go to **Clients** tab - you should now see real order counts and total spent
2. Go to **Projects** tab - create your first project
3. Link projects to clients
4. Track project progress

## What's Connected

```
Clients ←→ Projects (one-to-many)
Clients ←→ Orders (one-to-many)
Orders → Total Spent calculation
Orders → Order Count calculation
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Client Cards Now Show:**

   - Real total spent from orders (in KSh)
   - Real order count
   - No more hardcoded $0 and 0 orders

2. **Projects Tab:**

   - Full CRUD operations
   - Client dropdown selection
   - Status tracking
   - Budget management
   - Beautiful card-based UI

3. **Data Integrity:**
   - Deleting a client now also deletes related projects and orders
   - Proper foreign key relationships
   - Cascading deletes

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. Add project timeline/Gantt chart view
2. Add project expenses tracking
3. Link orders to specific projects
4. Add project photo gallery
5. Generate project reports
